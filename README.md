# parallax-text-effect-overlay

## Description 

_I recently got inspired by the designs on Awwwards and wanted to recreate a scrolling effect. The text overlays the image with a different color while scrolling on the Y axis on window scroll. This effect was done purely in javascript, no libraries used here. I'm thinking of using this effect on future projects._

## Image 

![]()

## Font

_The font used in this project is called 'Beatrice Display'._
